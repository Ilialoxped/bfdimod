 WGF_focus_our_situation: "Our situation"
 WGF_focus_our_situation_desc: "The previously calm Goiky has now plunged into chaos, and our position in this madness is unenviable. The banner of socialism now bears only a small fragment in the north-west of Goiky, surrounded everywhere by traitors and counter-revolution. The obvious fact is the inevitable spread of the dictatorship of the proletariat throughout the continent, but for now the revolution must go on the defensive and take a good look at its situation and surroundings."
